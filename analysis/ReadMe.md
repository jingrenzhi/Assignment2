Analysis findings:

In this assignment, I built a logistic regression model using the cohort.csv data to predict the probability of cardiovascular disease based on age, gender, and smoking status (whether the individual is a smoker or not). The results show that all three variables are meaningfully associated with the disease. Smoking and being female are significantly correlated with the disease. Being a smoker increases the likelihood of the disease and being a female decreases the likelihood. Both of these two factors have a p-value less than 0.05, indicating strong statistical significance. Age is also positively related to the disease, indicating older population has higher likelihood of the disease comparing to younger population, however it shows borderline significance. 

I did not use generative AI technology (e.g., ChatGPT) to complete any portion of the work.
